# Restaurant website. HTML and CSS Code Challenge #5

Actually, this website includes 2 completed tasks from
the [Codecademy challenge](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/html-and-css-code-challenges-for-beginners/).
I combined task
**#6 "Create a
product landing page"** with task **#7 "Create a restaurant website"** because I thought they were
quite
similar, and the tasks could relate to one website. I wanted to try something new here, so among my
main tasks was to create an interactive restaurant map and a burger menu in the mobile version of
the website without using JavaScript. It was very exciting and actually a bit sad because I
understand that knowing JavaScript would make all these things much faster. So I decided to start
learning JavaScript for a few hours a day in parallel with creating such educational websites as
this one. I'm sure it will be very interesting.

The design of this website uses images from the website of a Ukrainian
restaurant [100 ROKIV TOMU VPERED](https://www.100rokiv.com.ua/en).

### Create a restaurant website

A restaurant website is similar to a product landing page in that it should showcase the restaurant
and menu items appealingly. Itâ€™s more complex, though, with images of different foods and drinks.
Your web-site should include:

- A picture of the product
- A header and footer
- Columns
- Multiple sections
- Create a responsive restaurant website using a viewport and media queries

### My personal tasks

1. Add a burger menu to the mobile version of the website without using JavaScript.
2. Create an interactive table reservation map using only HTML and CSS.
3. Arrange dishes in the menu using `display: grid`.
4. Add an online order form to the website.
